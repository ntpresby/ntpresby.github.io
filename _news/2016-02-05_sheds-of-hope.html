The PCA’S Mission to North America’s Disaster Response team has a new warehouse to build Sheds of Hope for recent tornado victims! These sheds are free of charge to the victims and hold their belongings on their property while they re-build.
All materials, tools and training are provided. Join us on **Saturdays, February 13, 20, 27 and March 5, 12, 19, 9:00 am–3:00 pm** at the Tornado Response Base, 8464 Endicott Lane off of Buckner Blvd. 12-16 people each Saturday can build 2 sheds.

To sign up, contact John Browne, <jbrowne@pcanet.org> or 214-763-2791. All over 18 are welcome, but teens may help with an adult family member present. Please bring your own food and drinks. Great opportunity for you to organize your small group or Sunday School community to come one Saturday!

If Saturdays don’t work for you, Tuesdays and Thursdays, **10:00 am–3:00 pm** or **6:00 pm–9:00 pm**, are also available times to work.
